# Express Typescript OvernightJS lightweight starter template 

Express is `awesome`!! Typescript is `awesome`. I am a big fan of both and prefer to use them together. For a long time I looked for a good started template with very few pre-existing bells and whistles but could not really find any that suited my requirement. I am not saying that there aren't good templates out there but almost all have a lot of pre-existing setup already done with a whole lot of scaffolding, database configuration and middlewares already setup. Whenever I have used any of those, almost always I end up removing a lot of existing code. This is primarily why I am building this bare-boned template which will give you a structure to start your TS-Express project.

The only exception to the above-stated rule that I have made is using OvernightJs. I recently started using this tool this annotation/attribute based markup really make sense to me. The code is clean and very well structured. If you come from ASP.Net MVC / Spring background these will be right up your alley. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/overnight)
